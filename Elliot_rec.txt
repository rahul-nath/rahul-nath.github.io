To whom it may concern: 

I was Rahul Nath's professor for MATH 15: Mobile Application Development during January, 2014. In this intensive, month long course, students learned the basics of Android app development in a enterprise environment. This included working with git and GitHub to control/review code and submit pull requests; keeping a Trello board up to date; following MVC conventions in conjunction with AGILE methodologies; using libraries like Volley to make requests to a server, and Gson to handle the result; understanding the application/Activity lifecycle in order to transfer data between screens; and utilizing SQLite databases to persist data locally, among many other topics. 

Rahul was among the best students in the class. He contributed significantly to his team, demonstrating comfort with a team environment and a solid grasp of the material in a very fast moving course. What really stood out, however, was that he asked the right questions. When there was an issue his group was having, or when there was a particular problem that the class was trying to solve, Rahul was able to ask questions that got straight to the heart of the matter. 

From my experience with him, Rahul showed that he was both capable and willing to learn complicated concepts quickly, and apply them in a new arena. From this class, he has a solid grasp of Android development, and most importantly, he has the problem solving skills to take that even further.less
