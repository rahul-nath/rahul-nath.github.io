\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Udacity}
\descript{| Course Manager}
\location{Aug 2015 – July 2016 | Mountain View, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Automated student YouTube data collection for Udacity webcasts. I wrote a Python cron job that collected over 8 million data points, formatted and stored the data on Udacity's AWS RedShift server, and pipelined it into Chartio.

\item Created content and QA'd for Machine Learning, DevOps \& Android Basics.

\item Re-invented Intro to Programming Nanodegree (IPND) into exploratory program to other courses, increasing its enrollment by over 20\% -- the fastest growing nanodegree at Udacity.

\item Created webcast teaching sessions and authored lessons on virtualization and Python optimization constructs.

\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Naval Research Laboratory}
\descript{| Contractor }
\location{July 2014 – Sept 2014 | National Harbor, MD}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented a tool in Python to learn actions in polynomial time -- a previously intractable problem -- making it feasible to automate the process of environment knowledge acquisition for an A.I. agent.

\item Designed and implemented an algorithm in Lisp and Python to reduce prepositional and word-sense ambiguity in interpreted speech using contextual information.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Mobiquity}
\descript{| Android Developer Intern}
\location{May 2014 – July 2014 | Wellesley, MA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented communication and data collection between an EC2 server and an Android application for Mobiquity’s deltaIQ platform.

\item Created the UX, UI, and business logic for an indoor navigation application using Node.js, iBeacons, Google Glass, and AWS EC2, S3, Kinesis, and Cognito.

\begin{tightemize}
\item I evaluated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. Model was then used to predict the price of said homes.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\location{\color{blue}\underline{\href{https://github.com/rahul-nath/PrePost2/blob/master/final_try.py}{\color{blue}PrePost2}}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Using selenium, multiprocessing pools, and BeautifulSoup, I created a webscraper to collect documents and suggest 25\% more accurate environment domain models to be used by an artificially intelligent agent planning its actions. 
\end{tightemize}

\location{\color{blue}\underline{\href{https://rahul-nath.github.io/docs/youth_programs_paper.pdf}{\color{blue}"From Play to Work: Effect of Youth Programs on Dropout Rates"}}}
\begin{tightemize}
% \item An econometric study I performed exploring the relationship between high school drop out rates and extracurricular programs. Analysis available.
\item An econometric study I performed exploring the possibility that attendance of extracurricular programs intended to motivate and engage students – including youth programs and dropout prevention programs – is associated with a lower likelihood of dropping out for at-risk students. Analysis available upon request.
