% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the

\location{Aug 2015 – July 2016 | Mountain View, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed Udacity's first student-to-student video platform with integrated Slack orientation bot. Leveraged Python, Google App Engine, and Ruby on Rails. Slack orientation bot would introduce students in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree to Udacity resources.

\item Automated student YouTube data collection. Set up Python cron job that queries YouTube Analytics servers for data, formats data, and stores data on company AWS RedShift server, pipelining data into Chartio. 

\item Created webcast teaching sessions and authored lessons on virtualization and other topics. Helped students through projects for Intro to Programming and Machine Learning Nanodegrees.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Naval Research Laboratory}
\descript{| Summer Contractor }
\location{July 2014 – Sept 2014 | National Harbor, MD}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented a tool that reduces the time required for autonomous agents to acquire action models from exponential to polynomial, making it feasible to automate the process of knowledge acquisition.

\item Further research consisted of designing an algorithm to reduce prepositional and word-sense ambiguity in interpreted speech using contextual information and semi-supervised machine learning techniques.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Mobiquity}
\descript{| Android Developer Intern}
\location{May 2014 – July 2014 | Wellesley, MA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented communication and data collection between an Amazon EC2 server instance and an Android application for Mobiquity’s deltaIQ platform, which forms the basis of their health monitoring service (Java, Node.js, AWS)

\item Implemented the UX, UI, and business logic for Android apps that use cutting edge tech, like iBeacons and Google Glass

\item Utilized Amazon Web Services (EC2, DynamoDB, S3, Kinesis, and Cognito)

\runsubsection{Williams College Honors Research}
\location{Sept 2014 – Dec 2014 | Williamstown, MA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item PrePost2. Leveraged NLTK text mining to learn static predicates for domain models from sparse descriptions of action sequences, making domain models 25\% more accurate for automated planning engines. (Python)
