\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Udacity}
\descript{| Course Manager}
\location{Aug 2015 – July 2016 | Mountain View, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Re-invented Intro to Programming Nanodegree (IPND) into exploratory program to other NDs, increasing student enrollment by over 20\% -- the fastest growing ND at Udacity.

\item Created webcast teaching sessions and authored lessons on virtualization and Python optimization constructs.

\item QA'd and created content for Machine Learning, DevOps \& Android Basics.

\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Naval Research Laboratory}
\descript{| Contractor }
\location{July 2014 – Sept 2014 | National Harbor, MD}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented a tool in Python for A.I. robot to learn actions in polynomial time -- a previously intractable problem -- making it feasible to automate the process of knowledge acquisition.

\item Designed and implemented an algorithm in Lisp and Python to reduce prepositional and word-sense ambiguity in interpreted speech using contextual information and machine learning.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Mobiquity}
\descript{| Android Developer Intern}
\location{May 2014 – July 2014 | Wellesley, MA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented communication and data collection between an Amazon EC2 server instance and an Android application for Mobiquity’s deltaIQ platform, which forms the basis of their health monitoring service. Also used Node.js.

\item Created the UX, UI, and business logic for an indoor navigation app using iBeacons, Google Glass, and AWS EC2, DynamoDB, S3, Kinesis, and Cognito.
\end{tightemize}

\section{Projects}

\location{TA Sessions}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Conceptualized and developed Udacity's first student-to-student video platform with integrated Slack orientation bot for over 2000 students enrolled in IPND. Leveraged Python, Google App Engine, and Ruby on Rails.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\location{YouTube Data Pull}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Automated student YouTube data collection for all of Udacity. Wrote Python cron job that queried YouTube Analytics servers collecting over 8,000,000 data points, formatted data, stored data on Udacity's AWS RedShift server, and pipelined it into Chartio as a data source.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\location{\underline{\href{https://github.com/rahul-nath/PrePost2/blob/master/final_try.py}{PrePost2}}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Using selenium, multiprocessing pools, and BeautifulSoup, I created a webscraper to collect documents with sparse descriptions of action sequences. Docs were used to learn static predicates to generate domain models, making domain models 25\% more accurate for automated planning engines.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\location{\underline{\href{https://github.com/rahul-nath/medicost}{Medicost}}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Created website to easily search cost requests and receipts made by doctors to insurance companies, along with other information regarding the medical practice. Data was scraped from the Dept. of Health and Human services.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\location{\underline{\href{https://github.com/rahul-nath/SchoolStuff/blob/master/classes/comp_sci/cs237/wave2/wave3.s}{Virtual Assembly Emulation}}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Wrote a virtual emulator for a RISC assembly instruction set, WARM, using a CISC assembly instruction set, WIND. Wrote a JIT compiler to optimize.
\end{tightemize}
